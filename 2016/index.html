    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>Go faster than your competitors. That&rsquo;s the promise of microservices &ndash; deploy faster, scale faster, be more robust. It&rsquo;s all about outcomes and the way your organisation is structured has a tremendous impact on those outcomes. it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;Conway&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; and then move swiftly on. &ldquo;But but but, but how?&rdquo;<br /><br />In early 2014, James and Martin Fowler called out &ldquo;Organised around business capabilities&ldquo; as a core characteristic of microservices. This was based on feedback from successful teams around the world about how important this aspect was on the systems they were building. In this talk, James explores some of these structures and provides some practical guidance on what he and Martin meant when they said &ldquo;business capability&rdquo;.</p>

    
    <h4>James Lewis</h4>

    <p>James studied Astrophysics in the 90’s but got sick of programming in Fortran. As a member of the ThoughtWorks Technical Advisory Board, the group that creates the Technology Radar, he contributes to industry adoption of open source and other tools, techniques, platforms and languages. For the last few years he has been working as a coding architect on projects built using microservices; exploring new patterns and ways of working as he goes.<br /><br />James has spoken at a number of UK and international conferences. His previous topics range from domain driven design, SOA and the future of the web to agile adoption patterns and lean thinking. He’s also heavily involved in the fledgling microservice community. He rather likes the fact that he got to describe his take on things jointly with Martin Fowler in an article that is influencing how people see the future of software architecture.</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>A core aspect of a microservice architecture is individual deployability of services. Thus, orchestrating the roll out of these services should be as easy as possible. Historically Netflix has rolled out deployments using an open-source tool called Asgard. Spinnaker &ndash; the successor of Asgard and an open-source project as well &ndash; is a complete reimplementation of its predecessor and heavily improved.<br />The talk introduces Spinnaker, the challenges it's trying to solve as well as the core concepts it's talking about. We then discuss and demo setting up a build pipeline as well as the various options in deployment targets, rollout strategies etc.</p>

    
    <h4>Oliver Gierke</h4>

    <p>Oliver Gierke is the lead of the Spring Data project at Pivotal, formerly known as SpringSource, and member of the JPA 2.1 expert group. He has been into developing enterprise applications and open source projects for over 8 years now. His working focus is centered around software architecture, Spring, REST and persistence technologies. He is regularly speaking at German and international conferences and the author of technology articles as well as the first book on Spring Data.</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>When architecting an enterprise Java application, you need to choose between the traditional monolithic architecture consisting of a single large WAR file, or the more fashionable microservices architecture consisting of many smaller services. But rather than blindly picking the familiar or the fashionable, it&rsquo;s important to remember what Fred Books said almost 30 years ago: there are no silver bullets in software. Every architectural decision has both benefits and drawbacks. Whether the benefits of one approach outweigh the drawbacks greatly depends upon the context of your particular project. Moreover, even if you adopt the microservices architecture, you must still make numerous other design decisions, each with their own trade-offs.<br />A software pattern is an ideal way of describing a solution to a problem in a given context along with its tradeoffs. In this presentation, we describe a pattern language for microservices. You will learn about patterns that will help you decide when and how to use microservices vs. a monolithic architecture. We will also describe patterns that solve various problems in a microservice architecture including inter-service communication, service registration and service discovery.</p>

    
    <h4>Chris Richardson</h4>

    <p>Chris Richardson is a developer and architect. He is a Java Champion, a JavaOne rock star and the author of POJOs in Action, which describes how to build enterprise Java applications with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate. Chris was also the founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, an early Java PaaS for Amazon EC2. He consults with organizations to improve how they develop and deploy applications and is working on his third startup.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>Here we are: Microservices, Container, Cloud ... and lots of data to deal with. Usually that's where the real trouble starts. Many developers still base their designs on the concept of perfectly consistent ACID transactions, everything being always consistent and in order, no anomalies around.<br />But reality is different: Perfect consistency does not exist and many real-world use cases require much weaker consistency models in order to satisfy the scalability or robustness requirements.<br />So, what are our options and what is the price we need to pay? Do we need to accept potentially losing data in order to get higher availability? How much can I scale without compromising consistency?<br />In this session we will answer this and many more questions. We will also have a look at some popular data stores and examine what kind of consistency models you can achieve with them and how. Finally, we will have a peek into latest research and see new ideas that might push the borders of the current state-of-art.</p>

    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>In this talk, Head of Engineering Rodrigue Schaefer will discuss some of the challenges of Zalando's transition from monolith to microservices and how the company&rsquo;s engineering team has tackled them through a combination of organizational decisions and development of new tools. He&rsquo;ll discuss Zalando&rsquo;s open-source PaaS framework STUPS (stups.io), which was built in-house to enable multiple teams to use the full power of AWS without scarifying vital aspects like security, traceability and architectural standards. Docker has played a key role in this architectural transformation and helps us to realize an easy and robust deployment process.&nbsp;<br />Rodrigue will also discuss how Zalando engineers are taking a microservices approach to front-end as well as back-end, through a rebuild of the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;shop&rdquo;&mdash;the unit that includes our 15 country-specific, customer-facing websites. He&rsquo;ll describe how the team is using tools like Hystrix and various resilience libraries to manage its growing microservices ecosystem. Finally, he&rsquo;ll explain how microservices has enabled Zalando&rsquo;s tech team to achieve a culture of autonomy, mastery and purpose that encourages innovation and experimentation.</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>While many organizations are keen on breaking up their monolithic applications and establishing microservice architectures, only few of them truly appreciate the impact on runtime information like log data and metrics. But without it you are almost blind in production. And without correlating events from different sources it becomes very difficult to make sense of your metrics and to draw accurate conclusions. If you want to break monoliths into a variety of distributed services, standard approaches are no longer sufficient.<br />In this session, we will show the conceptual foundation and best-of-breed tooling for a monitoring solution of a decentralized and distributed application landscape.</p>

    <p><strong>1) Microservices - with Monolith and other Diseases (Felix M&uuml;ller)</strong><br /><br />Ongoing microservice transition since 2 years. Rotting distributed monolith in the background and still alive. And independent development teams as our ultimate goal. Join our journey to Microtopia.  In this talk I show you which problems we had to solve at E-Post since our microservice transition started. How do we set up 10 teams and empower them to work independently on their services? And which nifty challenges arise when you try to adapt your organizational structure to microservice architecture style. There is no silver bullet. I talk about our solutions and experiences with architectural constraints, technology stacks and humans.<br /><br /><strong>2)&nbsp;Challenges in adopting microservices for an internal service eco-sytem in a large corporation.&nbsp;(Shahzadz Hatim)</strong><br /><br />Before his current assignment the speaker had a year long opportunity to work for a corporation where microservices were chosen as the primary method of encouraging software re-use among independent business initiatives. The speaker and his team faced many challenges in adopting microservices architecture on top of the usual riddles of corporate software development. The challenges presented in this talk are specific to the case being described. However there are some learning pertinent for audience at large which this lightning-talk will summarise.<br /><br /><strong>3) Why microservices are not worth it! -- the long list of tradeoffs (Florian Thiel)</strong><br /><br /> Architecture decisions  always involve tradeoffs. A Conway-structured organization, risk reduction through small services and massive scalability sound like dream-come-true arguments for abandoning your monolith and joining the microservice camp.  Although nobody expects the transition to miroservices to be easy, I will argue that there is a very long list of often overlooked (or deemed very cheap) challenges. And maybe there is room for compromises...&nbsp;</p>

    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>The end to end response time of a network of microservices tends to have a wide distribution with a long tail at the 99th percentile, even if the mean is short. By collecting the response time distributions and throughput for request traces we can see how the individual microservices respond, but to combine these distributions and find which microservice is contributing the most to the 99th percentile requires application of montecarlo simulation. This talk will explain how this technique works and investigate tools ranging from Excel plugins to R packages that can implement montecarlo models.</p>

    <p>With more and more teams using the microservice architecture, and gaining the speed of delivery benefits that it provides, a challenge has emerged in teams that do not have sufficient experience with message-oriented systems. The network is unreliable, has many moving parts, and it&rsquo;s easy to end up in bad places. Avoiding the curse of the distributed monolith, and avoiding catastrophic failure, are immediate issues facing many new microservice systems. In this talk, a careful analysis is made of the many byzantine ways in which message-oriented systems can fail. A set of remedial approaches is presented, and an empirical report on there effectiveness will also be made.

    <p>Microservices promises faster development, deployments, scaling and all the goodies you always wanted but never had.

We were often faced with cultural, technical, and geographical challenges around harnessing the goodness of micro services which is very different from adopting them in a startup environment.<br />In this talk I will share my top lessons - these include both successes and failures - which were often difficult to digest.

Insteadof having an additional kernel layer like containers, they work by neverproviding things an app doesn't need and rely on hypervisors for isolation.Like containers, the idea is not new, but the first implementations are comingto a practically usable state. Which leaves us with a question: how do wedevelop software on top of them?<br />In this talk, I'll evaluate the current state of a unikernel andpresent a little distributed application on top of that.</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p><p>At SoundCloud we managed to break away from the monolith while delivering key business features. Our journey towards a microservices architecture has not been a straightforward one. We experimented a lot to reach the set of tools and technologies that we use today. We changed how we build our applications. We introduced specific apis for our mobile and web clients. We call them BFFs (backend for the frontend). They became the central piece of SoundCloud&rsquo;s architecture. We rethought how we monitor our services. We created a service registry for knowledge sharing. While making all these changes, we benefited from the learnings of our peer companies. This talk will share our learnings from this journey: what worked for us and what we moved away from.</p>
<br /></p>

    
    <h4>Bora Tunca</h4>

    <p>Bora is a software developer at SoundCloud. He started his journey there two and a half years ago. As a generalist, he has worked on various parts of their architecture. Nowadays he is part of the Core Engineering, where he helps to build and integrate the core business services of SoundCloud. When he's not juggling various languages, he's playing basketball - as long as someone on the team covers his on-call shifts...</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p><strong>1) &nbsp;Microservices and UI (Tobias Deekens)</strong><br /><br />Microservices are an accepted paradigm for backend software systems and show undeniable benefits. However, web applications - especially Single Page Applications - are often developed and deployed as a monolith bearing challenges regarding extensibility and maintainability. This session illustrates practicable patterns for modular web applications from development to deployment. Topics covered will briefly focus on recent evolutions enabling modular web applications and how an split up application can be efficiently served to a browsers. Therefore, the talk will also make brief references to current frameworks to extract their patterns dealing with reusability and compressibility while also pointing out how underlying developments in web standards help lay foundations to fight commonly faced issues. Solutions proposed will also make short references to existing systems developed at E-POST Development GmbH.<br /><br /><strong>2)&nbsp;Automatic Test generation for REST-APIs (York Xylander)</strong><br /><br />One of the main problems of coordinating multiple development teams in a micro-service architecture relies in API documentation and contract testing:One team has to inform other teams about its APIs and depends on other teams to be conform to the APIs they provide.While there are several de-facto standards for documentation of REST-APIs, creating a reliable in test-infrastructure in regard to conformance and downward-compatible changes is still a challenge.We will discuss an approach for contract testing based on Scala-Check and Swagger.<br /><br /><strong>3)&nbsp;A Microservices approach for Cloud Manufacturing (German Terrazas)<br /></strong><br />The future of industrial manufacturing increasingly depends on maintaining and expanding a resilient and sustainable sector based on sophisticated technologies, relevant knowledge and skill bases, and infrastructure that has the ability to produce a high variety of complex products faster, better and more cheaply, thus fostering the link across multiple geographically distributed manufacturers, suppliers and customers. In this talk we present our ongoing work in Cloud Manufacturing defined as an approach for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of physical manufacturing resources and capabilities that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Although manufacturing networks and virtual enterprise models already exist, native cloud architectures such as microservices play a key role to facilitate an optimal, efficient and fault tolerant modelling and implementation of such concept. In particular, we aim to show how our multi-layered Cloud Manufacturing conceptual architecture could be effectively delivered in terms of loosely coupled polyglot services, asynchronous communication and reactive modelling in order to virtualise, search, match, configure and combine a mixture of entities, roles, processes and information of different sorts of granularity from scratch to satisfy specific real world production requirements.<br /></p>

    
    <h4>Tobias Deekens</h4>

    <p>Tobias is working as a front end developer within a cross-functional team developing Single Page Applications at E-POST Development GmbH. He focusses on front end architecture, tooling and testing to increase developer experience. He is also an Open Source enthusiast and loves the open web.</p>
    
    <h4>German Terrazas</h4>

    <p>Dr German Terrazas is a research scientist at the University of Nottingham. He has expertise in artificial intelligence, distributed systems, optimisation, stochastic simulation, explorative data mining, complex systems and information processing. After working for more than a decade in computer science, German has recently moved to engineering to focus on the research and development of innovative computing and service-oriented platforms applied to the UK manufacturing sector. His current scientific interests comprise crowd sourcing, distributed architectures, virtualisation and data analysis. German’s professional career is demonstrated by his track record of publications, some of which awarded by IEEE, the organisation of international conferences, as well as the edition of books and journals.</p>

         <span class="fa fa-plus-circle pull-right"></span> 
    </a>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>Testing Microservices is hard!<br /><br />Or is it really? &nbsp;One of the precepts of TDD is that if something is hard to test, then potentially the design itself is at faulty.<br />With a sweep through design options for Microservices, it can be shown that testing Microservices does not have to be hard, and can become as straightforward as any other test. This does require a radically different design philosophy, which this talk will review and show applied.</p>

    <p>David Dawson is CEO of GoMicro.Services, takes his passion for design, architecture and philosophy to all their clients, drinks their coffee and gives them Microservice platforms and systems in return.<br /><br />Alongside running GoMicroservices, David advises the other Simplicity Itself companies, GoDataScience and GoCloudNative, dreaming, designing and building an event oriented cloud based artificially intelligent world.
